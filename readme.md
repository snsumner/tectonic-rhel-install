### Prerequisites

- Redhat Enterprise Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.x
  - Default security profile
  - Minimal Install
- VMware vCenter 5.5+ or higher
  - Administrator user required
- Linux or OSX machine to run Tectonic installer
  - With network access to vCenter server
- Tectonic installer 1.7.1
- Pre-allocated IP addresses for cluster and pre-created DNS records
- Optional: Load balancer to direct console and api traffic (F5, Netscaler, HAProxy)

## DNS and IP address allocation

Installation of Tectonic requires using static allocation of IP Addresses for VMware installation.

Prior to the start of setup create required DNS records. Below is a sample table of 2 master nodes, 3 etcd nodes and 2 worker nodes.

| Record | Type | Value |
|------|-------------|:-----:|
|tectonic.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.91 |
|api.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.92 |
|master-01.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.110 |
|master-02.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.111 |
|etcd-01.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.115 |
|etcd-02.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.116 |
|etcd-03.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.117 |
|worker-01.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.112 |
|worker-02.scottsumner.net | A | 192.168.1.113 |

In this example the virtual IP for console traffic will be 192.168.1.91, DNS resolvable at tectonic.scottsumner.net and the virtual IP for API traffic will be 192.168.92, DNS resolvable at api.scottsumner.net

## Generate SSH key for Tectonic installation

During the Tectonic installation you will need to provide SSH keys that will be used for accessing all the nodes within cluster during and after the installation. You can use an exist SSH key or generate a new one. This key needs to exist on the machine where the Tectonic installer will be executed.

1. On machine where Tectonic installer will be executed create ssh key by executing `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Confirm you have a id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file within ~/.ssh folder

## Creation of RHEL 7.x VM template

Prior to installation of Tectonic we need to create a RHEL 7.x VM template that will be used for the worker nodes. You will need to initial create worker nodes running Container Linux then you swap them out with RHEL worker nodes.

## Install Tectonic Cluster on VMware

Refer to instruction on installing Tectonic on VMware here: https://github.com/coreos/tectonic-installer/blob/master/Documentation/install/vmware/vmware-terraform.md

## Replace CL Worker with RHEL Worker

The assumption is that kubectl is already installed on machine where Tectonic Installer was execute.  If not please install kubectl using these instructions: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

1. On Tectonic Installer machine copy generated/auth/kubeconfig to ~/.kube by executing `cp generated/auth/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config`
1. Execute `kubectl get nodes` to verify cluster is running
1. Execute `kubectl cluster-info` to verify cluster information
1. Execute `kubectl drain worker-01 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data` to drain services on node we will replace with RHEL worker nodes
1. Execute `kubectl delete node worker-01` to remove container linux worker node
1. Within vCenter power of worker-01 VM
1. Within vCenter remove worker-01 VM from inventory
1. Within vCenter create New VM from rhel74_mimimal template
1. Select Folder used during Tectonic install (e.g. Tectonic171)
1. Name VM worker-01 (same name as old CL VM)
1. Select same ESXi host used previously during Tectonic install
1. Select same datastore used previously during Tectonic install
1. Power on worker-01 VM and open console and login as root
1. Use `nmtui` to edit connection / IPv4 / Manual switch ip address to the original IP of worker-01 (e.g. 192.168.1.112/24) and add correct Gateway (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
1. Set system hostname to worker-01 if its not already set.
1. Run `ip a` or `ipconfig -a` to confirm IP address is set correctly
1. Run `ping 192.168.1.1` to verify you can reach Gateway
1. On Tectonic Installer machine copy generated/auth/kubeconfig to new worker-01 node `scp generated/auth/kubeconfig core@worker-01:/tmp/kubeconfig`
1. On new worker-01 node move kubeconfig into /etc/kubernetes folder `sudo cp /tmp/kubeconfig /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig`
1. To install tectonic-release execute `sudo yum -y install tectonic-worker --nogpgcheck`
1. Edit kubelet.env by executing `sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.env` and change `KUBELET_IMAGE_TAG=v1.7.1_coreos.0`
1. Install Firewalld by executing `sudo yum -y install firewalld`
1. Start Firewalld by executing `sudo systemctl start firewalld`
1. Modify Firewalld zone by executing `sudo firewall-cmd  --zone=trusted --add-interface ens192` (ens192 might not be your interface)
1. Modify Firewalld default zone by executing `sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=trusted`
1. Verify Firewalld settings by executing `sudo firewall-cmd --list-all`
1. Setup cluster DNS IP by executing:
   - cat > tectonic-worker << EOF
KUBERNETES_DNS_SERVICE_IP=10.3.0.10
EOF

sudo sed -i 's|KUBERNETES_DNS_SERVICE_IP=|KUBERNETES_DNS_SERVICE_IP=10.3.0.10|g' \
     /etc/kubernetes/kubesettings-local.env
1. If the previous command doesn't work just create new file under /etc/kubernetes/kubesettings-local.env with the follow:
   KUBERNETES_DNS_SERVICE_IP=10.3.0.10
1. Also create /etc/sysconfig/tectonic-worker with the following:
   KUBERNETES_DNS_SERVICE_IP=10.3.0.10
   CLUSTER_DOMAIN=<base domain of Tectonic cluster>
1. Setup Flannel configuration by executing:
   - cat > 10-flannel.conf << EOF
{
    "name": "cbr0",
    "type": "flannel",
    "delegate": {
        "isDefaultGateway": true
        }
}
EOF
